**Date:** 01/07/2016  
**PC:** Exarchos  
**Operation:** restarting the switch / fixing the connection to router/internet.  
**Operator:** Robert Alm  
**Issue:** Connection problem because of the switch. the switch was not responding.I tried to solve that with restart but i got to be locked out from a homegroup. i tried to find o solution automaticaly and the result was that DNS server was not responding.  
**Resolve:** the issue is not solved.
