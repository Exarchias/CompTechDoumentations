**Date:** 01/07/2016  
**PC:** Exarchos  
**Operation:** restarting the switch / fixing the connection to router/internet.  
**Operator:** Robert Alm  
**Issue:** Connection problem between switch and the router/server Jo3.Kristianstad, probably because of the switch. the Jo3.Krstianstad is visible but something seems to be wrong. We tried to solve that with changeng IP,  but it seems we were not able to touch anything to the configuations with safety.  
**Resolve:** the issue is not solved. Probably is good idea to do a reset to my switch and maybe to change it with a new. I worry a bit if the problem is caused by my network card, then in this case i will have to change my network card as well.  
**SOS** It is a great idea to map my network, in order to be able to solve issues like that bit easier.
