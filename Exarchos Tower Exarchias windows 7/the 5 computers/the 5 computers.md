#The 5 computers - Documentation

On Wednesday the 10th of August i was assigned to prepare 5 computers for the new students that will come on 15th August. The mission took me 2 days with few implications that made the project more interesting and more fruitful in terms of experience.   
The lack of specific details about the computers  or the operations is because i didn't want to stress out my colleagues with extended notes or documentation.
  
##The 1st day (Wednesday 10 August 2016)

On Wednesday i prepared 3 computers and i checked more 5 PCs that unfortunately were not legit for the task on hand.

###1st computer.   
![the first computer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Exarchiasghost/CompTechDoumentations/master/Exarchos%20Tower%20Exarchias%20windows%207/the%205%20computers/photos/3-5c.JPG)
The first computer was pretty straight forward to get prepared for the newcomer.  
We unlocked the old Windows user with the program Hiren 15.2 only to check the if everything on the hardware was working properly without to be necessary to do the re-installation of the windows 7, (this is the mission of the newcomers).

I checked part of the hardware manually, (sound, dvd drivers, monitor keyboard, etc), and i checked the Drivers as well. everything gone smoothly with only exception 2 trivial drivers which were missing, (both about pci sockets)  
  
### 2nd computer

The second computer had few (unresolved issues).  
The first problem was some ominous electrical problem. when the computer was connected to the electrical socket, a strange sound was made, (like short circuit). The issue was bit trivial so i left a warning for further examination and i continue with preparing the computer.

Second issue was the cables in the interior and an additional hard drive was swimming in the interior.  
We attended the issue by taking off the additional  hard drive from the computer.

No issues with the rest of the process. We unlocked the previous user with Hiren 15.2 only to check if everything was working as it should.
Only issue detected were the two pci drivers that were missing on that computer as well.  
  
###The 3rd computer

The third computer didn't had any technical issue but to use the Hiren 15.2 was not an option because on this computer windows xp was installed and the Hiren 15.2 was not able to break, assumingly because of the path, but... it was not like a regular shell and i was lacking the time, the energy or the knowledge to fix that, so i decided to re-install windows in order to check if everything worked as it should.   
Everything was great with exception the trivial issue with the 2 pci drivers missing.
  
###The 5 rejected computers
As the title says those computers were rejected. Most of them were worthless. actually the were either spare parts, either old, either both. The most common problem was the lack of VGA port, that made them unsuitable for every any use.

##The second day (Thursday 11th of August 2016)
### The 4th computer - Exarchos (mine)

I gave up mine computer, (i had to switch to server machine anyway) in order to help with the collection of suitable computers for the new comers. i already new that my computer works perfectly, so i just gave it. Exarchos i will miss you dude.

###the 5th computer
Not a clue which computer it was, it got prepared by another person. Nothing to do with the last computer.
