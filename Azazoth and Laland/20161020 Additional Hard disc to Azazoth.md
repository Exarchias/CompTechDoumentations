#Additional hard disc on Azazoth 20161020

The Thursday the 20th of October i had to insert a second hard disc to Azazoth. The first time that i built Azazoth i thought that the second hard disc wasn't a necessity so I decided to deliver it back. As it seems my decission wasn't the right one and I had to install it again. at thise point i have to point out that this hard disc is not the same that i delivered back the first time.   
  
the best reason, (as I assume), for a second hard disc is because i will have two different AD so i will have to assign each one of them to different hard disc. Supposedly the existence of separate hard discs can give me few advantages on safety and speed, (i don't mean any raid topology), but nothing major, and probably it doesn't worth the fuzz to create backups for ADs of so small scale.  
  
 - It is important to point out that i didn't the **SMART** test but so far i concern my hard disc works greatly so i don't see any reasons to do more tests on my hard disc.  
  
 - Another thing that i wish to add is the fact that my new Hard disc it is assigned to the Letter **B**. I am not planning to use any diskette, and the letter **D** is usually taken for the dvd driver, and letter **E** for USB units.
