#Starting over again 21/10/2016

 - Unfortunatelly, my decision to create the first AD of the assignment (Endor.local), was wrong and the problem with windows server 2012 R2 is that it doesn't go on reverse so i had to reinstall the windows server 2012 r2

 - I decided to use the disc0 (and my fist hard disc as well) to allocate the partition C and the disc one, (the new additional disc), to free letter B.

 - By the installation i faced one problem. It wasn't visible any boot menu so we fixed that by pressing f8 and f10 separately. the problem is fixed but we will never know though where is the boot menu.

 - when i had the windows server 2012 r2 installed, my first action was to disable the IE advanced options, to disable the firewall for the privat network to use the IE in order to install Opera, and to load the video tutorials that i am using.

 - I installed Hyper-V to my machine and I configured my ipv4 to the following adresses:
	 - ip 10.20.0.158
	 - subnet mask 255.255.255.0
	 - standard gateway 10.20.0.1
	 - DNS 127.0.0.1  
	 
 - I faced a small problem for 10 or 20 minutes because i forgot to install DNS role so i wasn't able to connect to internet.

 - As i said previously i installed Hyper-V and DNS roles to Azazoth. On Monday logically i will start with the AD endor.local. I have to check though if i changed the name of the computer to Azazoth as I intended to do.
