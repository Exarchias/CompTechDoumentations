#Installing windows 7 professional on Lala1 Monday 05/09/2016

On Monday at the 5th of Septemeber of 2016 i was asked to reinstall windows 7 on my personal laptop that is destinated to be used as a client on my domain Laland and to became the Lala1.LALAND.local (name that i will be refere to from now even if the laptop is  not yet connected on the active domain.)  
  
I should make a notice that i took the windows as a trial, (without license), and this can cause problems when i will try to connect lala1.LALAND.local to the LALAND.local.  
  
I noticed something that can be considered as a main breakthrough in order to make my life easier and the life of other students easier. i noticed that the laptops that we are using, (EliteBook 8440p) every time we are trying to install windows to them, (i can confirm for windows 7 but i suspect that the issue applies to other OS as well), there are specific drivers that are missing.  
  
I isolated them and i made a list of them, i am thinking seriously to make a folder on my folder "Movant" on github to have them only and reachable all the time. thing that is not totally usefull because the students, (or I), will have to download the drivers separatetly and that is not the most usefull thing to have (especially with the missing ethernet and network drivers) so i will have to zip them and upload those on Dropbox or something like that.   
I will come back to this later. For now i will just list the isolated drivers:
