#Adding stuff to endor.local 29/09/2016

On Monday 19/09/2016 i started the process to install a new active domain directory that will be in the domain endor.local and it will have computer, users, and OU according to the instractions, and it has to be copied on a hyperV virtual domain, (i will return to this part when the time will come later... the instructions are bit unclear. )  
  
The task that i had on hand on monday was:  

##To create groups and users to endor.local

After the first shock with the creation of the domain the process got pretty simple. of course the situation gets complicated  by the many elements and by the many depedencies.  
So my mission was to add users and groups to the folders and to give the necessary privileges to every user according to the his relation to the group. The things was not that strict and i had the chance to put my rules inside plus some inactive templates, (thing that i decided not to do for reasons of avoiding mistakes - i wish to going through the theory one more time to be sure.) 

##What i added to the domain so far
I have done the following structure.   
Please be aware that i choose not to share details about the privileges here, (the infos about them are in the document anyway... no surprises here).  
###endor.local
- Users
	- Percy Nilegård
	- Elisa Andersson
	- Kurt Nilsson
	- Adam Svensson
	- Lotta Luvine
	- Kalle Oborne
	- Ada Adair
	- Erik Lallerstedt
	- Laura Mauritz
	- Greger Lindström
	- Kjell Hansson
- Groups
	- Admin 
	- Data
	- Ekonomi
	- Göteborg
	- Lager
	- Ledning
	- Malmö
	- Sälj

And i will continue to adding more stuff always according to the instructions, (probably i will upload photos about that but for now i am done).
