#Adding stuff to endor.local 03/10/2016

On 03/10/2016 i continue with my assignment on endor.local 

##To add folders to endor.local near the main particion C: on Azazoth.endor.local

the process to make the folders as childs to the folder/particion C was easy, (it is just the process to create folders, and i could make automated through cmd if i wanted but... how much autamtion is necessary for 8 folders?). the part to assoicate the folders with the groups and the users was bit more tricky but nothing that difficult.
  
###the folders that i added to C:
- Endor AB
	- Admin 
	- Data
	- Ekonomi
	- Göteborg
	- Lager
	- Ledning
	- Malmö
	- Sälj
	- Verkstad  

##What i added to the domain so far
I have done the following structure.   
Please be aware that i choose not to share details about the privileges here, (the infos about them are in the document anyway... no surprises here).  
###endor.local
- Users
	- Percy Nilegård
	- Elisa Andersson
	- Kurt Nilsson
	- Adam Svensson

	- Kalle Oborne
	- Ada Adair

- Groups
	- Admin 
	- Data
	- Ekonomi
	- Göteborg
	- Lager
	- Ledning
	- Malmö
	- Sälj
	- Verkstad  
  
And i will continue to adding more stuff always according to the instructions, (probably i will upload photos about that but for now i am done).
