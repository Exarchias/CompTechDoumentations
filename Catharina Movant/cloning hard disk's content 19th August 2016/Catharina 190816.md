#Catharina Project 190816
##the cloning of the content of a disc by using Active Boot Disc (by Lsoft)
  
The Friday the 19th of August a assigment was presented to me with the task to co-oparate with two other operators, (names are not important) to use a software application called Active boot disc which is made by Lsoft in order to clone the whole content of a laptop which belong to a Movant member which name is Catharina, (so comes the name of the project/laptop), to a mobile disc drive (260GB with the name Ebook as i believe) and then to load back the image to the laptop formating the precious content.  
  
The operation was successful but it was reported few errors, (btw i took the decision to verify the result of the cloning for more safety).  
We decided to continue with the loading of the image to the laptop despite the errors, (no fatal error was detected anyway and the content of the laptop was reportedly broken), so by using the same software, (Active Boot Disc by Lsoft) in order to load the image of Catharina's laptop to the hard disc of Catharina's laptop.
The load process is completed successfully with only exception a very expected problem with the drivers, (many drivers of the laptop were away).  
  
On this point i have to explain that it was an ominous mistake, (the details were not 100% clear to me) about the user existence in the domain. something about the privileges if i get it right. The many details of this case are not known to me, and i don't have the clear picture of the Domains architecture, (i am not a domain expert either), and so long the error is not my doing i will enjoy temporarily my ignorance.  
  
I resolved the issue with the Drivers. unfortunately  i forgot to take notes so i don't have a list about which drivers were installed, as i recall they were the two PCI drivers that they use to be uninstalled to all Movant computers, an ethernet driver, and something about the chipset and an feature of biometric, (a very old and assumingly unistalled feature that old laptops used to have - I have never seen this feature to work correctly anywhere).
